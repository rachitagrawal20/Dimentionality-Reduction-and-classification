# Dimentionality-Reduction-and-classification
PCA(Principle Component Analysis), RCA(Relevent Component Analysis), LDA(Linear Discriminant Analysis) have been used to reduce the dimensions of WINE dataset from UCL. Further KNN has been applied for classification and accuracy is compared.
Also visualizations are produced for IRIS dataset from UCL, however classification is not attempted here.
